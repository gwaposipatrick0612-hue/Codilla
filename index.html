  <h3>Who is Clarence Dale Codilla?</h3><br>
  <p>I am someone who prefers to stay low-key, but I hold strong values when it comes to respect. 
    I give it where it’s due, and I deeply care about the people who genuinely care for me. I'm not the type to put myself in the spotlight, but behind the scenes, 
    I’m full of passion and purpose. My name is Clarence Dale Codilla, born and raised in Cebu City, and ever since I was young, music has been a huge part of my life. 
    I’ve written two original songs — "When You're Not Around" and "Worth It All". These songs are pieces of my soul, expressing what words alone sometimes can’t. 
    I'm drawn to slow rock bands like Cueshé, Hale, Creed, Green Day — their music speaks volumes to me. But I also thrive in the raw energy of hard rock and nu-metal. 
    Bands like Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, Metallica, Slipknot, Linkin Park, 
    and Evanescence have shaped my taste and mindset. Music, for me, is both a comfort and a battle cry.</p>
    <p>
Outside of music, I have a strong love for machines — especially classic big bikes and sleek JDM or luxury cars. 
There’s just something about speed, style, and power that excites me. Athletics has always been another outlet of expression. 
I played volleyball competitively, trained as a martial artist, practiced MMA, and even boxed at the well-known ALA Gym in Mandaue. 
Those experiences taught me discipline, pain, and strength — both physical and mental. I studied under the HUMSS strand in senior high, exploring the depths of humanity and social sciences. 
But when I entered college, I made a practical shift — BS Information Technology. It was my second choice, but I saw the demand and future in it. 
Sometimes, life isn’t just about passion — it’s about being smart and strategic, too. If there’s anything I’ve learned through the years, it’s this: you don’t need to be loud to be heard. 
Stay true to who you are, respect those who respect you, and never stop fighting for your growth — silently, steadily, and fiercely.
</p>
<p>Despite the hardships life has thrown at me, I have never once stopped fighting. No matter how tough the battle gets, giving up has never been an option. 
  Every challenge I face only fuels my determination to rise higher and become stronger. I believe that strength is not just about physical power, but about the will to keep moving forward when everything seems to be against you. 
  I fight not only for myself but for those who believe in me and for the dreams I refuse to let go of. This journey, full of trials and setbacks, has shaped me into the person I am today — resilient, focused, and unbreakable. 
  I’ve walked through pain most people never saw, kept silent when I could’ve screamed, and stood tall even when life tried to break me. 
  I’ve been doubted, ignored, and misunderstood — but that never stopped me. Because I know my worth, and I don’t need to shout just to prove it.</p>
